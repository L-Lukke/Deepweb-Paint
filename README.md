# Deepweb-Paint
A cursed ""paint"" developed in college to the Computer Graphics course, all instructions are in the program, you just have to run it using `python3 tp.py` or even better just download the exe and run it (although i dont actually recommend anyone downloading random stuff from the internet and running it without looking at the code).
